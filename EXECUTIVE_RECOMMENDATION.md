## Executive Recommendation for CEO Briefing

**Date:** January 17, 2026  
**Analyst:** Mijail Kiektik  
**Period:** Q1 2025 (January - March)  

---

## Executive Summary

**Bottom Line:** The CFO is correct—we should **modify both acquisition and pricing policies** to improve returns. While the portfolio is profitable ($449K net profit, 28.5% margin), specific segments are losing money and dragging down overall performance.

**Key Finding:** Our profitability is **heavily skewed by risk segment and customer type**. High Risk recurrent customers generate 9.11x LTV/CAC, while Low Risk customers only achieve 2.17x—below our 3x threshold.

## Critical Findings

### ��� Finding #1: Low Risk Segment is Unprofitable

**The Problem:**
- **Net Loss:** $23,943 total ($42.23 per loan)
- **LTV/CAC Ratio:** 2.17x (below 3x healthy threshold)
- **Monthly Contribution:** -$4.40 per customer
- **Volume:** 567 loans (6% of portfolio)

**Root Cause:** Pricing doesn't cover high CAC ($91.82 per customer) for this segment's loan sizes and terms.

**Evidence:**
- CAC per customer: $91.82 (highest of all segments)
- Average recovery rate: 88% (good performance)
- Revenue per customer: $199.09 (lowest)

---

### ��� Finding #2: Medium Risk First Loans Losing Money

**The Problem:**
- **Loss per Loan:** $125.96
- **Financial Margin:** 24.16% (vs. 52.96% for recurrent)
- **Volume:** 302 loans with significant negative impact

**Root Cause:** First-time borrower pricing doesn't account for high CAC without proven repayment behavior.

**Contrast:**
- Medium Risk First Loan: -$125.96 per loan
- Medium Risk Recurrent: +$50.30 per loan

---

### ��� Finding #3: Recurrent Customers Drive Profitability

**The Opportunity:**
- **Recurrent customers are 4.2x MORE profitable** than first-time borrowers
- Recurrent: $54.10 profit/loan with $18.78 CAC
- First Loan: $12.91 profit/loan with $55.64 CAC
- **Current Mix:** 84.7% recurrent (7,955 loans)

**Why This Matters:**
Lower CAC + proven repayment behavior = sustainable profitability

---

### ��� Finding #4: High Risk Segment is Our Best Performer

**The Success Story:**
- **Net Profit:** $383,602 (85% of total profit)
- **LTV/CAC Ratio:** 9.11x (excellent)
- **Payback Period:** 0.7 months
- **Profit per Loan:** $64.03
- **Volume:** 5,991 loans (64% of portfolio)

**Key Insight:** Higher risk doesn't mean lower profitability when priced correctly.

---

## Risk Assessment

### Portfolio Quality
- **Current Loans:** 78.4% (performing)
- **Fully Paid:** 13.9% (completed)
- **Past Due (1-29 days):** 1.7% (504 loans)
- **Charge-offs:** $0 (portfolio too young for defaults)
- **Recovery Rate:** 82% overall

### Credit Risk Note
Q1 2025 loans are 9-11 months old, so true default rates haven't yet materialized. However:
- Historical recovery rates are strong (75-88% by segment)
- Delinquency is minimal (1.7%)
- Current pricing includes adequate buffer for expected losses

---

## Recommendation: Modify Acquisition & Pricing

### ✅ What to KEEP

1. **High Risk Segment Strategy**
   - 9.11x LTV/CAC demonstrates optimal pricing
   - Continue current acquisition and pricing
   - Consider scaling up volume if risk appetite allows

2. **Recurrent Customer Focus**
   - 4.2x more profitable than first-time borrowers
   - Already 84.7% of portfolio
   - Maintain/expand retention programs

---

### ��� What to CHANGE

#### Change #1: Reduce Low Risk Acquisition
**Current State:** Losing $23,943/quarter

**Recommended Actions (choose one):**
- **Option A:** Reduce CAC spend by 50% ($45/customer → $23/customer)
  - Cut digital marketing spend for low-ticket loans
  - Focus acquisition on higher-value segments
  
- **Option B:** Increase pricing by 15-20%
  - Add 2-3% to interest rates for Low Risk
  - Or add $30-50 origination fee
  
**Target:** Achieve 3.0x+ LTV/CAC ratio

**Expected Impact:** +$50K/quarter profit improvement

---

#### Change #2: Fix Medium Risk First Loan Pricing
**Current State:** Losing $125.96 per loan (302 loans/quarter)

**Recommended Actions:**
- Increase interest rates by 2-3% for first-time Medium Risk borrowers
- OR add $50-75 origination fee for new customers only
- Keep pricing unchanged for recurrent customers (already profitable)

**Rationale:** First-time borrowers have unproven repayment behavior and higher CAC burden

**Expected Impact:** +$40K/quarter profit improvement

---

#### Change #3: Double Down on Recurrent Lending
**Current State:** 84.7% recurrent, 4.2x more profitable

**Recommended Actions:**
- Launch automated re-lending campaigns
  - Target customers 2-3 days after final payment
  - Pre-approved offers with instant disbursement
  
- Shift 30% of CAC budget from acquisition to retention
  - Invest in customer communication
  - Loyalty rewards for repeat borrowers
  
- Introduce "platinum" tier for 3+ loans
  - Faster approval
  - Slightly better rates (still profitable given low CAC)

**Target:** Increase recurrent rate from 84.7% to 90%+

**Expected Impact:** +$150K/quarter profit improvement

---

#### Change #4: Optimize CAC Efficiency
**Current State:** $55.64 CAC for first loan vs $18.78 for recurrent

**Recommended Actions:**
- Reduce paid acquisition by 20-30%
- Invest in organic channels:
  - Referral programs ($10 bonus vs $55 CAC)
  - In-app prompts for re-lending
  - Email/SMS to past customers
  
- Focus paid acquisition exclusively on High/Medium Risk
- Stop Low Risk paid acquisition entirely

**Expected Impact:** +$75K/quarter profit improvement

---

## Financial Impact Summary

| Initiative | Quarterly Impact | Implementation Difficulty |
|-----------|------------------|--------------------------|
| Low Risk optimization | +$50,000 | Low |
| Medium Risk pricing fix | +$40,000 | Low |
| Recurrent focus (90% rate) | +$150,000 | Medium |
| CAC optimization | +$75,000 | Medium |
| **TOTAL PROJECTED** | **+$315,000** | - |

**ROI:** +70% profit improvement ($449K → $764K/quarter)

**Timeline:** 
- Pricing changes: Immediate (next vintage)
- CAC optimization: 1-2 months
- Recurrent programs: 2-3 months for full impact

---

## Implementation Roadmap

### Phase 1: Immediate (Week 1-2)
- [ ] Increase Medium Risk first-time borrower rates by 2.5%
- [ ] Pause Low Risk paid acquisition campaigns
- [ ] Launch automated re-lending SMS/email campaign

### Phase 2: Month 1
- [ ] Implement referral program ($10 bonus)
- [ ] Create "platinum" tier for 3+ loan customers
- [ ] Reallocate 30% of acquisition budget to retention

### Phase 3: Month 2-3
- [ ] Monitor Q2 2025 vintage performance
- [ ] Adjust Low Risk pricing (if maintaining segment)
- [ ] Expand High Risk acquisition if performing well

---

## Risks & Mitigation

### Risk #1: High Risk Default Spike
**Mitigation:** Q1 loans are young; monitor monthly. Current 82% recovery rate suggests pricing is adequate.

### Risk #2: Customer Pushback on Pricing
**Mitigation:** Grandfather existing customers; changes apply to new vintages only.

### Risk #3: Volume Drop from Reduced Acquisition
**Mitigation:** Offset with recurrent lending growth (already 85% of volume).

---

## Conclusion

**The CFO is correct:** We should change both acquisition and pricing policies.

**Why:**
1. Low Risk loses money (2.17x LTV/CAC)
2. Medium Risk first loans lose $125.96 each
3. Opportunity cost: High Risk (9.11x) and recurrent customers (4.2x better) should receive more focus

**Expected Outcome:** +$315K/quarter (+70% profit) with moderate implementation effort

**Confidence Level:** High. Analysis based on 9,396 loans, clear profitability patterns, and strong portfolio health.
