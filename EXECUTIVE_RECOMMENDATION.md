## Strategic Recommendation

### ✅ MAINTAIN current acquisition strategy

**Rationale**:
1. All risk segments profitable with LTV > CAC
2. Loss rates exceptionally low (0.03% overall)
3. Contribution margins near 100% across all cohorts
4. High Risk segment delivering best risk-adjusted returns (5.6x LTV/CAC)

### 🎯 OPTIMIZE pricing on Low Risk segment

**Recommendation**: Increase pricing 3-5 percentage points on Low Risk segment

**Expected Impact**:
- Improve LTV/CAC from 1.2x to 1.8-2.0x range
- Maintain competitive positioning
- Minimal risk to acquisition volumes

**Alternative**: Reduce CAC spend on Low Risk to improve unit economics

### 📊 MONITOR March 2025 vintage

**Action Items**:
1. Track charge-off development through Q2 2026
2. Analyze cohort behavior at 6-month maturity
3. Assess if March represents seasonal pattern or policy shift

### 🚀 FOCUS growth on High Risk segment

**Rationale**:
- Highest LTV/CAC ratio (5.6x)
- Current pricing captures risk premium effectively
- Strong credit performance despite risk classification
- 64% of current volume - scale opportunity exists

## Decision Framework

### If CEO position prevails (maintain policies):
✅ **SUPPORTED BY DATA**
- Current strategy is working exceptionally well
- Risk-return profile is optimal
- No immediate need for changes

### If CFO position prevails (change policies):
⚠️ **NOT SUPPORTED FOR ACQUISITION**
- All segments showing positive returns
- Changing risk targeting would reduce overall profitability
- High Risk segment is the best performer, not worst

✅ **SUPPORTED FOR PRICING OPTIMIZATION**
- Low Risk segment pricing below optimal
- Targeted price increases would improve returns without significant risk

---

## Assumptions & Limitations

1. **Data Period**: Analysis covers Jan-Mar 2025 disbursements observed through Dec 2025 (10-12 months seasoning)
2. **Funding Cost**: Calculated from charge-off amounts; assumes full loss on defaulted capital
3. **COGS**: Based on actual operational costs per loan
4. **CAC**: Zero for most customers suggests organic/low-cost acquisition
5. **Maturity**: Further losses possible but unlikely given current trends

---

## Conclusion

**The data strongly supports maintaining current acquisition policies across all risk segments.** The portfolio is generating exceptional returns with minimal credit risk.

**Recommended action**: Keep current strategy with **targeted pricing optimization** on Low Risk segment to improve unit economics.

The debate between CEO and CFO should shift from "change vs. maintain" to "how to optimize an already successful strategy."

---

## Next Steps

1. Present full analysis with supporting data
2. Model pricing scenarios for Low Risk segment
3. Establish monitoring framework for March 2025 vintage
4. Develop growth plan for High Risk segment scaling
